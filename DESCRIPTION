Description: this packages allows processing image data based on the method described in the following publication:
    Féret, J.-B., Asner, G.P., 2014. Mapping tropical forest canopy diversity using high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy. Ecol. Appl. 24, 1289–1296. https://doi.org/10.1890/13-1824.1
    It expects a raster file as input, with ENVI HDR header file including spectral bands of the sensor, if optical sensor.
