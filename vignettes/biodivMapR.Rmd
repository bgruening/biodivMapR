This tutorial describes the processing workflow for `biodivMapR`. It
goes through the different steps for the production of spectral
diversity maps using Sentinel-2 imagery. The workflow is divided into
three steps:

-   Acquisition of the Sentinel-2 imagery Sentinel-2 is downloaded from
    a STAC catalog using the package
    [`preprocS2`](https://jbferet.gitlab.io/preprocs2/), which is a
    wrapper of the [`rstac`](https://brazil-data-cube.github.io/rstac/)
    and [`CDSE`](https://zivankaraman.github.io/CDSE/) packages.

The default STAC collection is
[`sentinel-2-l2a`](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/sentinel-2-l2a)
from the Planetary computer catalog.

-   Preparation of the data `biodivMapR` requires a raster / set of
    raster as input data. The first `biodivMapR v1` used spectral
    transformations as initial pre-processing step. This included
    reflectance normalization with a continuum removal, followed by a
    spctral transformation (PCA, SPCA, MNF...).

`biodivMapR v2` now allows user to run the preprocessing step of their
choice. This can consist in computing spectral indices, vegetation
biophysical variables, or spectral transformation. This also means that
any type of input data can be used, as long as the input rasters share
the same footprint, spatial resolution and projection.

We provide a few examples here. Users can experiment with the method of
their choice

-   Definition of the processing parameters This includes the following
    information:

    -   input / output files paths
    -   output spatial resolution (window size)
    -   pre-processing and processing options

-   Computation of the diversity maps This includes several diversity
    metrics:

    -   $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversity maps as defined in [Feret & Asner
        (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1890/13-1824.1 "Feret&Asner2014") and
        [Feret & de Boissieu
        (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13310 "Feret&deBoissieu2019")
    -   Functional diversity maps, including Richness, Evenness and
        Divergence as defined in [Villeger et al.
        (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1890/07-1206.1 "Villeger2008")

### biodivMapR v1
Please refer to the branch [`dev_v1`](https://github.com/jbferet/biodivMapR/tree/dev_v1) of the package for the previous versions and tutorials. 
Vignettes and tutorials corresponding to this version are still available [here](https://github.com/jbferet/biodivMapR/tree/dev_v1/vignettes). 

We recommend using the most-up-to-date versions of `biodivMapR`, as the previous ones will not be maintained.

<!-- ## Partitioning of spectral diversity into $\alpha$ and $\beta$ components -->

<!-- The partitioning of spectral diversity is based on the `specdiv` function provided by [Etienne Laliberte on Github](https://github.com/elaliberte/specdiv "specdiv"). The original method does not use the exact same normalization, and only the framework starting from component selection is used here. Future versions will include the full original framework.  -->
